# Quick-Maffz  
Basic java excercise, creating methods to perform arithmetic operations 
on two int values.

A check is performed in the division / modulo functions to ensure no 
error is thrown from trying to divide-by-zero.  
This is a basic 'if' to ensure a is not smaller than b, rather than 
catching an exception.  
  
## Usage:  
Two setter methods are used to set the two-int values a and b  
i.e: `setA(5)`  
  
There are then several methods that can be called for the various 
arithmetic operations (each returns some numeric value)  
`addition()` would return the sum of whatever a and b have been set to.
